	
John Adams (1735â€“1826) was an American statesman, attorney, diplomat, writer, and Founding Father who served as the second president of the United States 
from 1797 to 1801. Before his presidency, he was a leader of the American Revolution that achieved independence from Great Britain. During the latter part 
of the Revolutionary War and in the early years of the new nation, he served the U.S. government as a senior diplomat in Europe. Adams was the first person 
to hold the office of Vice President of the United States, serving in the role from 1789 to 1797. He was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with 
important contemporaries, including his wife and adviser Abigail Adams and his friend and political rival Thomas Jefferson. This oil-on-canvas painting of 
Adams was produced by Gilbert Stuart, approximately between 1800 and 1815, and is in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
